- get to work on camera class (2d orthographic)
- make world placeholder in order to get camera right
- add triangles and/or quads to simple draw to make world look better
- maybe make simple draws singletons OR 2 instances in a pluralton
- consider transient simple draws and permanent simple draws so that things like the world don't need to be re-fed every frame into simple draw
- unify singleton, pluralton public api.  move private contructor check to Initialize for pluralton.
