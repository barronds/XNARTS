- consider game cameras as pluralton
- consider simple draw method to draw whole map given array of colors, or index into color map
- make the mouse work
- consider game system interface (update, render)( gametime ) from Utils folder maybe, game types file



- make a game configuration class that has initial data and that systems can tweak early so that all systems 
may initialize irrespective of construction and initialization of those systems, hopefully.

thinking about this one now.  how to integrate the initial per-system modification of the config.
through a InitConfig() method?  can i still use that through singletons?  
take everything out of constructors and do specific intialization?

- make input manager that abstracts away touch vs mouse controls, maybe encapsulates unit selection, commands
- maybe event system for input events
