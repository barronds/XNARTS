- consider simple draw method to draw whole map given array of colors, or index into color map
- make the mouse work

- make input manager that abstracts away touch vs mouse controls, maybe encapsulates unit selection, commands
- have test mode for assert that facilitates unit tests surviving assert.  fix existing tests with commented out tests.  (not sure how to do this actually).
- extend event system to allow immediate callback over messages. 

- add ordering to events, a globally unique order so that start and end events can be interpreted correctly

- gui system
- get fonts rendering in screenspace
- get touch working for taps, holds

- do the right inheritence with events

- have state machine states and transitions return possible triggers and process that in touch.
- have state machine update take incoming trigger, and hook that up in touch.
