Rendering

- consider simple draw method to draw whole map given array of colors, or index into color map
- add circles to simple draw

Controls

- make the mouse work
- text based debug command system (maybe) (debug?)
- make input manager that abstracts away touch vs mouse controls, maybe encapsulates unit selection, commands

Map

- octaves and features to map

UI

- make new Placement class as a base, with subclasses for pos, pos + aabb, relative placement, etc.
- map types on selector
- map sizes on selector
- create placeholder placement type and placeholder parenty

Events

- extend event system to allow immediate callback in addition to messages. 
- add ordering to events, a globally unique order so that start and end events can be interpreted correctly
- for listener / broadcaster, have utility functions that shorten the usage

Tests

- have test mode for assert that facilitates unit tests surviving assert.  fix existing tests with commented out tests.  (not sure how to do this actually).

Bugs

- find sudden zoom bug
- button push while generating map, undesirable
