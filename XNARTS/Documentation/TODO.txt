- consider simple draw method to draw whole map given array of colors, or index into color map
- make the mouse work
- text based debug command system (maybe)

- make input manager that abstracts away touch vs mouse controls, maybe encapsulates unit selection, commands
- have test mode for assert that facilitates unit tests surviving assert.  fix existing tests with commented out tests.  (not sure how to do this actually).
- extend event system to allow immediate callback in addition to messages. 

- add ordering to events, a globally unique order so that start and end events can be interpreted correctly

- octaves and features to map
- try map lines instead of checkerboard

- selector
- map types on selector
- map sizes on selector
- refactor style to have just one font
- add text offset correction

- find sudden zoom bug

- add circles to simple draw

- button push while generating map, undesirable
